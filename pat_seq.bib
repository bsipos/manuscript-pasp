	abstract = "Poly(A) tails enhance the stability and translation of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs, but difficulties in globally measuring poly(A)-tail lengths have impeded greater understanding of poly(A)-tail function. Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA-mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.",

	abstract = "Tandem 3' UTRs produced by alternative polyadenylation (APA) play an important role in gene expression by impacting mRNA stability, translation, and translocation in cells. Several studies have investigated APA site switching in various physiological states; nevertheless, they only focused on either the genes with two known APA sites or several candidate genes. Here, we developed a strategy to study APA sites in a genome-wide fashion with second-generation sequencing technology which could not only identify new polyadenylation sites but also analyze the APA site switching of all genes, especially those with more than two APA sites. We used this strategy to explore the profiling of APA sites in two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MB231, and one cultured mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A. More than half of the identified polyadenylation sites are not included in human poly(A) databases. While MCF7 showed shortening 3' UTRs, more genes in MB231 switched to distal poly(A) sites. Several gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways were enriched in the list of genes with switched APA sites, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. These results suggest a more complex regulation of APA sites in cancer cells than previously thought. In short, our novel unbiased method can be a powerful approach to cost-effectively investigate the complex mechanism of 3' UTR switching in a genome-wide fashion among various physiological processes and diseases.",

In contrast to the PAT assay, the new method is based on the enzymatic 3' elongation of mRNA with guanosine residues, thus immediately preserving the 3' end of the RNA and creating a unique poly(A)-oligo(G) junction. The oligo(G)-protected full-length poly(A) tail is reverse transcribed using the universal anti-sense primer oligo(dC(9)T(6)) and amplified by PCR with a gene-specific sense primer. After sequencing the resulting RT-PCR product the length of the poly(A) tail was unequivocally deduced from the number of adenosine residues between the oligo(G) stretch and the sequence upstream of the poly(A) tail. The efficiency and specificity of the newly developed assay was demonstrated by analysing the poly(A) tail length of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) RNA. We show here that the poly(A) tail of HAV RNA rescued after transfection of in vitro transcripts was elongated in the course of HAV replication.",

Thus, measurement of the poly(A)-tail associated with any given mRNA at steady-state can serve as a surrogate readout of its translation-state.

More recent genomic analysis has established the generality of the PAS for eukaryotic mRNA. Evidence for the mechanism of mRNA 3'-end formation is outlined, as is the way this RNA processing reaction communicates with RNA polymerase II to terminate transcription. The widespread phenomenon of alternative poly(A) site usage and how this interrelates with pre-mRNA splicing is then reviewed. This shows that gene expression can be drastically affected by how the message is ended.

We review the field from the perspective of poly(A) tail length. Length control is important because (1) poly(A) tail shortening from a defined starting point acts as a timer of mRNA stability, (2) changes in poly(A) tail length are used for the purpose of translational regulation, and (3) length may be the key feature distinguishing between the stabilizing poly(A) tails of mRNAs and the destabilizing oligo(A) tails of different unstable RNAs. The mechanism of length control during nuclear processing of pre-mRNAs is relatively well understood and is based on the changes in the processivity of poly(A) polymerase induced by two RNA-binding proteins. Developmentally regulated poly(A) tail extension also generates defined tails; however, although many of the proteins responsible are known, the reaction is not understood mechanistically. Finally, destabilizing oligoadenylation does not appear to have inherent length control. Rather, average tail length results from the balance between polyadenylation and deadenylation.",

Some components of the yeast Ccr4-Not complex, which regulates transcription as well as transcript turnover, have previously been linked to DNA damage responses, but it is unclear if this involves transcriptional or post-transcriptional functions. Here we show that CCR4 and CAF1, which together encode the major cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase complex, have complex genetic interactions with the checkpoint genes DUN1, MRC1, RAD9, and RAD17 in response to DNA-damaging agents hydroxyurea (HU) and methylmethane sulfonate (MMS). The exonuclease-inactivating ccr4-1 point mutation mimics ccr4Delta phenotypes, including synthetic HU hypersensitivity with dun1Delta, demonstrating that Ccr4-Not mRNA deadenylase activity is required for DNA damage responses. However, ccr4Delta and caf1Delta DNA damage phenotypes and genetic interactions with checkpoint genes are not identical, and deletions of some Not components that are believed to predominantly function at the transcriptional level rather than mRNA turnover, e.g., not5Delta, also lead to increased DNA damage sensitivity and synthetic HU hypersensitivity with dun1Delta.

The conservation of alternative polyadenylation type or polyadenylation configuration between human and mouse orthologs is statistically significant, indicating that alternative polyadenylation is widely employed by these two species to produce alternative gene transcripts. Genes belonging to several functional groups, indicated by their Gene Ontology annotations, are biased with respect to polyadenylation configuration. Many poly(A) sites harbor multiple cleavage sites (51.25\% human and 46.97\% mouse sites), leading to heterogeneous 3' end formation for transcripts. This implies that the cleavage process of polyadenylation is largely imprecise. Different types of poly(A) sites, with regard to their relative locations in a gene, are found to have distinct nucleotide composition in surrounding genomic regions. This large-scale study provides important insights into the mechanism of polyadenylation in mammalian species and represents a genomic view of the regulation of gene expression by alternative polyadenylation.",

@article{fuke07,
	abstract = "Different RNA species are rigorously discriminated and exported by distinct export factors, but this discrimination mechanism remains largely unknown. We previously showed, by RNA microinjection experiments, that intronless mRNAs are discriminated from U snRNAs based on their difference in RNA length. However, it was unclear how they are discriminated in the natural situation in which their nascent transcripts emerge progressively during transcription. We hypothesized that transcription from the corresponding promoters is important for this discrimination. Here we show that contrary to our hypothesis, the discrimination process was not significantly influenced by whether transcription occurred from an mRNA- versus a U snRNA-type promoter. Rather, the features of transcribed RNAs determined the RNA identity, consistent with our previous results of RNA microinjection. Moreover, we found that the poly (A) tail can function as an identity element for mRNA export. The presence of a poly (A) tail of an appropriate length committed otherwise short Pol II transcripts to the mRNA export pathway in a dominant manner, indicating that the poly (A) tail either contributes to increasing the RNA length or functions as a platform to recruit mRNA export factors. Our results reveal a novel function of the poly (A) tail in mRNA export.",

	abstract = "Polyadenylated mRNAs are typically more strongly repressed by microRNAs (miRNAs) than their nonadenylated counterparts. Using a Drosophila melanogaster cell-free translation system, we found that this effect is mediated by the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). miRNA repression was positively correlated with poly(A) tail length, but this stimulatory effect on repression was lost when translation was repressed by the tethered GW182 silencing domain rather than the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) itself. These findings are mechanistically explained by a notable function of PABP: it promotes association of miRISC with miRNA-regulated mRNAs. We also found that PABP association with mRNA rapidly diminished with miRISC recruitment and before detectable deadenylation. We integrated these data into a revised model for the function of PABP and the poly(A) tail in miRNA-mediated translational repression.",

@article{preiss98,
	abstract = "The cap structure and the poly(A) tail synergistically activate mRNA translation in vivo. Recent work using Saccharomyces cerevisiae spheroplasts and a yeast cell-free translation system revealed that the poly(A) tail can function as an independent promotor for ribosome recruitment, to internal initiation sites within an mRNA. This raises the question of how regulatory upstream open reading frames and translational repressor proteins binding to the 5'UTR can function, as well as how regulated polyadenylation can support faithful activation of protein synthesis. We investigated the function of the regulatory upstream open reading frame 4 from the yeast GCN 4 gene and the effect of IRP-1 binding to an iron-responsive element introduced into the 5' UTR of reporter mRNAs. Both manipulations effectively block cap-dependent translation, whereas ribosome recruitment promoted by the poly(A) tail under non-competitive conditions can efficiently bypass both blocks. We show that the synergistic use of both, the cap structure and the poly-A tail enforced by mRNA competition reinstates the full extent of translational control by both types of 5' UTR regulatory elements. With a view towards regulated polyadenylation, we studied the function of poly(A) tails of defined length on the translation of capped mRNAs. We find that poly(A) tail elongation increases translational efficiency, particularly under competitive conditions. Our results integrate recent findings on the function of the poly(A) tail into an understanding of translational control.",
